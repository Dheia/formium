# Formium

Even though forms power the modern web, they haven't really changed since the mid-2000s (and neither has the software used to make them). Drag-and-drop tools still can't handle complex business logic or even basic dynamic data. Hand-coded forms are still tedious and time-consuming, even with the latest JavaScript frameworks and libraries.

The result is wildly inefficient. You have a bunch of "in-app" forms coded by the engineering team that require you to make a JIRA ticket just to update and then whatever the marketing, support, and research teams use these days. SurveyMonkey? Airtable? TypeForm? Google Forms? You're not really sure at this point. Data is littered EVERYWHERE. The URLs are mess. The UI and UX are wildly inconsistent. Accessibility is an afterthought.

We need something else. 

A fresh take on the internet's most dreaded feature. Architected for the way we build apps today.

## What is Formium?

Formium is an **API-first, headless online form builder and automation tool** designed for high performance teams. In addition to hosting forms and surveys on [formium.io](https://formium.io), you can use your own React components to natively render your forms and surveys in your existing apps and websites. No iframes necessary.
