# Advanced Submission Variables and Templating

This guide offers some tips when setting up custom actions.

## Submission Variables

Submission variables are important because they allow you to personalize messages by using the details of the form submission. Type `{{` to open the dropdown menu to see your options – your form fields and other relevant details will show up. We highly reccomend using `{{values.name}}` or your equivalent to personalize your salutation.

## Templating Pro Tips

Both the Rich Text and Raw HTML editors can be used very effectively to create good email templates. **Raw HTML** will let you do anything you can do in HTML – insert images, do some cool inline css (as long as it's email supported), or use tables.
