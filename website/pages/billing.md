# Billing

Formium offers both a free tier and a paid tier depending on your needs. While the free tier comes with certain restrictions, the paid tier offers unlimited submissions and uploads. Each billing cycle we charge for the paid tier in two ways:

- **Base rate**: A fixed rate depending on your plan.
- **Usage rate**: A variable rate that is calculated based on your usage of the service.

The base rate is charged at the beginning of each billing cycle, while the usage rate is charged at the end of the billing cycle after we are able to calculate your usage.

A project's monthly billing date occurs on the same day that a paid plan was selected for the project. If the day does not exist in the current month (e.g. February 30), then the billing date is the last day of the month.
