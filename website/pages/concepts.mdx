# Formium Concepts

Formium provides a powerful structure for working with forms (and thus data).

At its core, a domain model creates a web of interconnected objects. Each object, or entity, within this model is representational and incorporates both behavior and data. Formium has six main entity types: user, customer, project, form, submission, media, and action. This guide will walk you through each of these entities, as well as their relation to each other.

## User

A user is anyone with a Formium account. Users can either be invited to an existing project (and customer), or sign up individually. If a user has signed up individually, a new project (and customer) is automatically created.
In any case, an existing user can always create additional projects or be invited to other existing projects.

## Project

A project is a collection of forms, submissions, and actions. Users belong to projects as either members or administrators.

- `Forms`: Comprise of a schema and a place to list submissions. All members of a project can view and edit forms.
- `Submissions`: Individual responses to a form. They trigger actions when they are created.
- `Actions`: A process or event triggered by a new submission. A single action can be re-used/and assigned to multiple forms within a project.
- `Logs`: Recorded HTTP and SMTP request and response logs of actions

## Customer

A customer is a billing entity (i.e. a credit card). Project belongs to exactly one customer. Although the underlying data structure exists, at the moment, a customer and a project have a 1:1 relationship for non-enterprise accounts in the UI. However, for enterprise accounts, a customer can have multiple projects (1:many). Billing usage is aggregated across all projects owned by the customer.
